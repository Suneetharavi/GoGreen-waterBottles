              What's Wrong With Plastic Water Bottles?
            </h2>
            <p class="text"> One plastic water bottle can take up to 450 years to decompose. We, as a society, want to reduce our carbon footprint. Disposing of 
              water bottles causes issues as well. If the billions of water bottles 
              in landfills werenâ€™t enough, 80% of plastic water bottles become litter, 
              adding to another kind of pollution. Along with the obscene amount of 
              pollution, oil and fossil fuels are necessary to make these bottles. This 
              adds  to another issue, global warming. Not only do plastic bottles 
              harm our environment, but they are also harmful to our human bodies. 
              Currently, microplastic is an issue causing harm to marine life and the 
              concern for microplastics to cause harm to our human bodies is growing. 
              Therefore, there needs to be a solution to these issues!

               Hence, our dissolvable water bottles!
